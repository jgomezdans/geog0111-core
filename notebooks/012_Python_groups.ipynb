    "In this section, we have extended the types of data we might come across to include groups . We dealt with ordered groups of various types (`tuple`, `list`), and introduced the numpy package for numpy arrays (`np.array`). We saw dictionaries as collections with which we refer to individual items with a key.\n",
    "\n",
    "We learned in the previous section how to pull apart a dataset presented as a string using loops and various using methods and to construct a useful dataset 'by hand' in a list or similar structure. It is useful, when learning to program, to know how to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we saw that packages such as numpy provide higher level routines that make reading data easier, and we would generally use these in practice. We saw how we can use `zip()` to help load a dataset from arrays into a dictionary, and also the value of using a dictionary representation when saving numpy files."
